## why i built this & what's next

all the online tools i found had a bunch of ads, weird loading states, bad ux, etc. so i decided to build my own!

this was a quick ship - but i'm sure i'll add more rsa-related tools in the future like encryption/decryption 👀

if there's anything specific you'd like to see, feel free to open an issue or a pull request!
